      ## What is Surveillance Capitalism?

      ---

      ---

      1

      An economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales

      ---

      2

      A parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral  modifications

      ---

      3

      A rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of welth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history

      ---

      4

      The foundational framework of the surveillance economy

      ---

      5

      A significant threat to human nature in the 21st century [...]

      ---

      6

      The origin of a new instrumentarian power that asserts dominance over society and presents startling challenges to market democracy

      ---

      7

      A movement that aims to impose a new collective order based on total certainty

      ---

      8

      An expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as coup from above: an overthrow of the people's sovereignty

      ## Surveillance Capitalism

      --

      - is an economic order and logic, not just a business model

      --

      - it uses technologies and machine intelligence to extract but cannot be reduced to a single or set of technologies

      ---

      # The book's structure

      --

      - The foundation: the invention and early development of SC

      --

      - The advance: migration from the online to the real world

      --

      - Instrumentarian power: shifting from the real world to the social world

      --

      - Zuboff's take on how to reclaim *our future*

      ## All about Google

      ---

      ## Google's discovery: Why?

      --

      - Google offered search as a service but didn't make money from it

      --

      - Added ad placement to generate revenue, like its competitors

      --

      - To actually be competitive, they needed to make sure their ad placement was the most successful

      --

      -> Shifting from ads based on the query

      to ads targeted to the individual doing the search

      ---

      ## Google's discovery: How?

      --

      - Google had always collected data to improve search

      --

      - Not all data was being used to reinvest into the product

      --

      -> Data exhaust: data that was accumulated as a side product

      ---

      ---

      ## Google's success

      --

      - Enter machine intelligence: analysis of the data exhaust revealed behavioral patterns down to an individual level outside the main service purpose

      --

      - These patterns could be used to make predictions on when/ what/ how an individual would do something (eg click on an ad)

      --

      - The surplus came at no additional cost, but sold as prediction products they yield massive revenues

      --

      - Google made predictions their main product

      "Google discovered that we are less valuable

      than other's bets on our future behavior." [2]

      ---

      ## Google's secret

      --

      - To target every individual you have to have data on every individual

      --

      - UPI: user profile information that "may be provided by the user, [...] by a third-party [...] and/or derived from user actions" [3]

      --

      - "UPI [...] can be determined [...] even when no explicit information is given to the system" [4]

      --

      -> The individual cannot refuse the processes. They lose their right to decide.

      Surveillance Capitalism builds on asymmetries of power and knowledge that already impact society as a whole today.

      ---

      # Personal notes

      --

      - Appreciated the holistic approach of describing systems

      - The topic is heavy and the writing is dense, it's not an easy read

      - Names and describes a lot of concepts that I struggled to explain in the past

      ---

      # How does it relate to CTech?

      --

      - Understand the how and why technology is made; its purpose in society and within an economic order

      --

      - Break the asymmetry of knowledge and power through education and our work

      ---

      # Discussion points


      - Have you heard of SC before? How does the topic make you feel?

      - Would you create work around SC? How would that look like?

      - SC was born in the US but has spread worldwide. Do you know of stories in other countries that helped spread SC or struggles against it?
