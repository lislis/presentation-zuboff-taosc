      ## What is Surveillance Capitalism?

      ---

      1

      an economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales

      ---

      2

      a parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral  modifications

      ---

      3

      a rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of welth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history

      ---

      4

      the foundational framework of the surveillance economy

      ---

      5

      a significant threat to human nature in the 21st century [...]

      ---

      6

      the origin of a new instrumentarian power that asserts dominance over society and presents startling challenges to market democracy

      ---

      7

      a movement that aims to impose a new collective order based on total certainty

      ---

      8

      an expropriation of critical fuman rights that is best understood as coup from above: an overthrow of the people's sovereignty

      ---

      SC is not a single technology

      it uses technologies, machine intelligence and other means

      ## The behavioral surplus

      - how Google figured out how to make money from search

      - collecting data to improve the user facing service

      - data exhaust: data that is being collected without use for the same service, a surplus at no additional cost

      - advertisement: knowing when to show each individual exactly what they need/ want

      - through analysing their data exhaust, Google managed to make predictions when and how to effectively place ads for advertisers, fully automated and with certainty

      - generating surplus became the actual goal: more data on various aspects of live on every person is needed to predict accurately and sell these predictions

      - from customer to the data mine

      ## The unprecedented

      - we fail to fully grasp things that we've never uncountered before

      - we use concepts and framing to explain and make sense of that new thing

      - but inevitably, we fail to get the entire picture because we've never seen it before

      This is why we could not stop SC until now:

      Privacy advocation and anti-monopolisation efforts target old capitalism, but not SC in its entirety

      ---

      ## The cycle of Dispossession

      ---

      # Personal notes

      - appreciated the intersectional, holistic approach of describing systems

      - highlighting 'historical' events of the last 20-30 years

      - there is a lot of the social and human psychological content that I left out but that is super interesting

      ---

      # How does it relate to CTech?

      - understand the how and why techonology is made; its purpose in society and within an economic order

      - break the asymmetry of knowledge and power through through education and our work

      ---

      # Discussion points


      - Did you think about SC before? How does the topic make you feel? How would you channel these feelings into your work?

      - SC was born in the US but has spread worldwide. What are circumstances in other countries that helped spread SC or struggles against it and its outcomes?

      - Can you think of other examples of the dispossesion cycle that you whitnessed with other companies/ products?
