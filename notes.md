## The age of surveillance capitalism

released in 2019

description of the origins and workings of a new mutation of capitalism that she named

not only about the business model of Google, Facebook or Silicon Valley but a hollisic view of historical, social, philosophical, as well as economical and technological developments in the West/ Global North that led to it and what circumstances made them possible to spread this new kind of capitalism globally

the main parts are adequitely name the Beginning, Advance and ?

We'll focus on the first Part, how surveillance capitalism came to be

Since she's the first to name and describe a lot of the systems that make surveillance capitalism work

That's why I picked some of the these systems that I found personally the most fascinating that she describes in the first part as the main structure of this presentation and try to summarize them term first

But first, what is the definition of SC



## The Beginnings of surveillance capitalism

### The unprecedented

You cannot grasp or regulate what you don't fully unsterstand

You will look at an unprecedented thing through lenses that you know

and miss the whole picture

Conventional privacy and monopoly regulations fail, because they don't understand this new capitalism

### The Behavioral Surplus

from a relationship of symmetric power between user and Google

![the diagram]()

to an asymmetrical relationship

all the additional data that was saved for each query, the data exhaust, the surplus

statistically analysed, it offered predictions

it was only good, if it could be delivered for EVERY person, no matter if they were aware or opted in

!! insert key factors that allowed this to happen
  - free speech rethoric
  - neoliberal practices
  - post 9/11 surveillance needs

The market rewarded Google with money

We are not the product, we are the mine

![the updated diagram]()

-> Extraction imperative

More surveillance, more data
More data, more predictions
better predictions, more money
And not just search, email followed, maps/earth/streetview to reach into the 'real' world

Google gets around lots of privacy regulations, because it doesn't sell personal data, it sells behavioral futures


### The Disposession Cycle

How does Google get to claim ever more territory for data extraction?

Keeping people from deciding/ preventing the possibility of deciding therefore being an anti-democratic

1. Robbery/ Claim

2. Habituation

3. Adaption

4. ??

Google mingles with the state, academia, civil society to make sure people don't question their practises

Their workings are secret and need to be to prevent outcry and backlash

They are the neofeudal aristocrats of the 21st century, data scientists the priests of their data cult

## It's dark

The advance, the remedies

## How does Surveillance Capitalism realate to us as CTechies?

- As users and often promoters of technology, it's important to understand how technology works. In this age, more often than not, also why technology is made the way it is, under surveillance capitalism it's to extract behavioral data.

- We educate through art and technology and this field, considering the unidirectional extraction or the power asymmetry in SC, we should be able to show and explain the workings and try to tear down as much of the moat as possible


## Questions / Discussion points

- A lot of groundwork was laid in the US and with specific circumstances to US mentality and laws. What are circumstances in other countries that helped spread SC or struggles against it and its outcomes?

- Can you think of other examples of the dispossesion cycle that you whitnessed with other companies/ products?

- Did you think about SC before? How does the topic make you feel? How would you channel these feelings into your work?
